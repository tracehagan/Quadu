 // The Motor class contains data and operations (functions) for one motor.
 // In the Motor class: "static Motor motors[4];" creates an array of 4 motors.
 //
 // Each motor has a "pin" on the Arduino, that outputs a PWM signal to the motor
 // to control the motor speed.
 // Each motor has its own "value" which is the speed (PWM) given to the motor.
 //
 // The four motors share ("static") information:
 //    minPWM - The minimum PWM value needed to spin the motor.
 //	  hoover - The approximate PWM value needed for the quad to take off.
 //    active - Must be true for motors to turn -- a safety lock.
 //
 //
 //	The Motor class has operations that can be performed on each motor:
 //		Off () - Turn off the motor.
 //		Set () - Set the speed (PWM) for the motor (only if Active is true).
 //
 // The four motors share some common operations:
 //		Rev () - Turn on each of the motor to maximum speed and then turn them off. The motors
 //			will be turned on and off in order: Front, Back, Left, and Right. This command is used
 //			test the motors and their wiring. If the motors do not turn on in the right order,
 //			they are wired to wrong connections. If they do not sound like they are rev-ing
 //			up to a high speed, there is either a loose connection, partially broken wire,
 //			or a bad Mosfet. If the motors do not turn off, you have a bad Mosfet.
 //		Active (status) - Turn off all the motors. If status is false, lock the motors so they
 //			cannot be turn off until Active is called with a true status.

 // The Flight class tracks and controls the overall fight of the quad.
 // Only one Flight exists, because we only have one quad. Everything is accessed statically.
 //
 // attitude[4] - contains direction the quad is facing and its altitude
 // desiredAttitude[4] - is direction and altitude we want the quad facing.
 //      When the quad is level with the ground it will stay in one place.
 //		When the quad tilts (e.g., pitches the nose up), the quad will move in that direction.
 //		When the side motors turn faster or slower than the front/back motors, the quad yaws (turns).
 //		So by setting an attitude other than level, the quad will move. You are now in control!
 //
 //	PID Pids[4] - one PID for each axis (Pitch, Yaw, Roll, and Altitude).
 //
 //	What is a PID? Good question!
 //	PID stands for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative.
 //  Ok, so what does that mean? Another good question!
 //
 //	PID is a very common control mechanism. In our case we are trying the control the Pitch,
 //	Yaw, Roll, and Altitude of the quad; by setting the motor speeds.
 //	So for example, by keeping the front motor at a constant speed and changing the speed
 //	of the back motor, we control the pitch.
 //	The keeping the front and back motor speeds constant, we simultaneously add (or subtract
 //	speed to the side motors to adjust yaw. Then we can add speed to one side motor and
 //	simultaneously subtract the same speed from the other side motor, to adjust roll (left or
 //	right wing higher than the other).
 //
 //	How does changing the speed of the side motors affect yaw? The front and back motors spin in
 //	one direction (lets say clockwise). The two side motors spin in the other direction, lets say
 //	counter clockwise. Imagine, you only had one motor, lets say it was spinning its propeller
 //	clockwise. If the motor is attach to the quad and the quad is sitting on the floor, then
 //	friction would keep the quad from spinning is the opposite direction of the propeller. But
 //	once in the air, the quad would spin. On a regular helicopter there is a tail rotor
 //	(propeller) to prevent the spinning. In the same way, if all four motors on the quad spun
 //	propellers in the same direction, the quad would spin in the opposite direction. By putting
 //	two motors in one direction and the two motors in the other direction, they counter each
 //	others force to spin the quad. When we want the quad to turn (spin just a little), we speed
 //	up (or slow down) the motors going in one direction.
 //
 //	Ok, so what is PID and why are we using PID? PID is the control mechanism that tells us
 //	how much power to apply to each motor. If we want to front and back motor to apply the
 //	same amount of lift (so the quad remains level), why not give them both the same amount
 //	of power?
 //		- Remember you slapped the (heavy) battery on the bottom of the quad. Probably not
 //		    exactly in the middle, so one motor need to lift more to balance thing out. Also
 //			the wings and motors are not all glued on exactly straight.
 //		- Motors were selected to give a lot of power at an affordable price. Some motors will
 //			spin faster with the same power.
 //		- ...
 //	So we have to set the front motor based on the throttle, then adjust/twiddle with back
 //	motor to keep thing balance. With four motors to twiddle with, a person could not keep
 //	up. So PID does the twiddling.
 //
 //	PID is algorithm, a computer formula. PID has two inputs: the desired output and the
 //	current output (e.g., Pitch). PID then produces the Input (motor speed) that might
 //	make the Current Output become the Desired Output. Might? PID does not get it right the
 //	first time, but it keeps trying.
 //
 //	Why doesn't PID get it right the first time? Imagine your car is stopped. You want to know
 //	how hard to push on the gas pedal to make the car go 60 miles per hour. Well first, no matter
 //	how hard you press on the gas, your car is not going to be going 60 mph after one second. So
 //	PID would have to give the car a lot of gas to get the car going and accelerating. AS we get
 //	closer to 60, we have to ease of the gas so we don't keep on accellarating to 70, 80, ...
 //
 //	The Proportional part of PID, increases the Input based on how far we hare from the
 //	desired Output. If we are far away, add a lot; so we get there faster. If we are close,
 //	add just a little; so we don't zoom past our goal.
 //
 //	The Integral part of PID, increases the Input based on how far and how long we have been
 //	away from the desired Output. Proportional is the main factor driving us toward the
 //	desired Output. But if Proportional is not getting us there fast enough, Integral
 //	gives the extra juice to get us there faster.
 //
 //	The Derivative part of PID, controls the Input based on how fast the Output is changing.
 //	The Derivative smooths out changes.
 //
 //	The quad uses Proportion and Integral. It does not use Derivative.
 //
 // --------------------------------------------------------------------
 //
 //	Begin () - Initializes the Flight controls (turn off the motors).
 //
 //	SetThrottle(speed) - Set the speed of the front motor (and gives a quick
 //		adjust to the other motors).
 //
 //	Update(yaw, pitch, roll) - Does the PID magic and updates the motor speeds.
 //
 //	Light (light, value) - Turns on light to a specified brightness.
 //
